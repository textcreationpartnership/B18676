            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the Inhabitants of the <hi>Hamlet</hi> of <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> with Relation to their late Petition for a Supply toward Building a <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Chappel,</hi> for the Ʋse of the said Inhabitants, Humbly laid before the Honourable House of Commons.</head>
            <p>THE Hamlet of <hi>Spittle-fields</hi> is part of the Parish of <hi>Stepney,</hi> Their <hi>Parish Church</hi> is far <hi>distant,</hi> and not very large, The <hi>Parishioners</hi> so Numerous as in the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> to bear the Proportion of more than <hi>two Thirds</hi> to the whole <hi>City of London</hi> within the Walls.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the said Hamlet of <hi>Spittle-fields</hi> by a moderate estimate, amount to more than <hi>fifteen thousand Souls,</hi> and their <hi>Poors Rate Communibus Annis</hi> is not less then <hi>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Numbers being so great, they have often desired <hi>a Church or Chappel of Ease, with a Burying-Place,</hi> which might hold some Proportion to them: And the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Wright the present Vicar of</hi> Stepney, has several times declar'd his Readiness to promote the same by his own Friends and Interest.</p>
            <p>Some Years since Sir <hi>G.W—r to</hi> encourage the Building of such a Church or Chappel, by a <hi>Solemn Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> drawn up by <hi>himself,</hi> and under <hi>his own Hand</hi> promis'd <hi>Five Hundred Pounds</hi> in Money and Moneys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, and some of the Inhabitants subscribed readily; yet, though <hi>Trading</hi> were then very <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Inability</hi> of the said Inhabitants to accomplish so great a Work appear'd but the more plainly, and the <hi>Design</hi> prov'd <hi>Abortive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1693. Sir <hi>G. W—r,</hi> with the Assistance of Mr. <hi>Tho. Seimour</hi> Goldsmith, purchas'd an <hi>old Tabernacle</hi> and set it up on a little piece of Ground of his own; the <hi>Purchase, Remove,</hi> and <hi>Fixing</hi> it, cost <hi>One Hundred Pounds:</hi> The Dimensions of the Tabernacle are about 30 <hi>Foot wide,</hi> 50 <hi>long;</hi> the Ground it stands on is 16 <hi>Foot Southward,</hi> but cut off by a Brick-House 12 <hi>Foot Northward,</hi> 8 <hi>and</hi> 9 <hi>Westward, and</hi> 10 <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> A Garden lies on the South, out of which he promis'd 100 <hi>Foot in length, and</hi> 30 <hi>Foot in Breadth</hi> for a <hi>Passage and Burying-Place:</hi> And this he pretended to give to the Hamlets of <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> the <hi>Old Artillery-Ground,</hi> and <hi>Northeme Falgate,</hi> for a <hi>Place of Divine Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Northeme Falgate</hi> and <hi>the Old Artill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry-Ground</hi> are <hi>Extraparochials,</hi> are inhabited by more then <hi>Four Hundred Families,</hi> and have no manner of Concern with <hi>Spittle-fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Provision for this Tabernacle was <hi>a Pulpit, a Reading Desk,</hi> and <hi>two and twenty Fourms</hi> of about Eleven Foot each in length.</p>
            <p>On this Mr. <hi>Milbourne</hi> a Conformable Clergy-man adventur'd, and open'd the Place with <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> on <hi>Christmas</hi>-Day, in the Year 93. He was <hi>approv'd and recommended</hi> by the <hi>Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>chosen and agreed</hi> to by the <hi>People, accepted</hi> by Sir <hi>G. W—r,</hi> the People being the more satisfied by reason of those Hopes they had, that their Forwardness might be a Motive to the <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> when the <hi>Act for Building and Finishing the Cathedral of St.</hi> Pauls should be renewed, to grant that <hi>Humble Petition,</hi> they have now with all submission given in to this <hi>Honourable House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>G. W—r</hi> profest openly, That He gave the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> aforesaid, to the <hi>Hamlets</hi> above-named, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated</hi> their Choice of Mr. <hi>Milbourne,</hi> who was Licensed accordingly, at Sir <hi>G. W—rs own Motion, by the Bishop himself,</hi> to be <hi>Curate</hi> there. Mr. <hi>Milbourne</hi> officiated duly, <hi>Pray'd, Preach'd, Catechis</hi>'d con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, was respected, brought many to the Publick, got <hi>a reasonable Subsistence</hi> among them; The <hi>Hearers</hi> laid out more than <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> in <hi>Seats and Galleries</hi> for the greater Convenience, so as its capable of near <hi>five Hundred People,</hi> and all this in Confidence of Sir <hi>G. W—rs</hi> kind meaning, and an <hi>Opportunity of Petitioning this Honourable House</hi> on the now emergent Occasion for some Assistance to Build a greater, and more convenient Place for Worship.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>G. W—r</hi> soon cut off the <hi>Entail</hi> of the Ground on which the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> stood, and instead of <hi>settling it in Trustees</hi> for the Use of the <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> settled it on <hi>himself and his Heir Male,</hi> during each of their Natural Lives, and after their Decease to Devolve on <hi>Lincoln College</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he takes upon himself as <hi>Minister of the Tabernacle,</hi> Disturbs the <hi>Curate</hi> in Officiating;
<note n="*" place="margin">Such as Singing Psalms before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Morning and Evening Prayer, Preaching in the Surplice, singing a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Psalm before the Litany, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Communion-Service on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Days, with nothing on the Table but a Linnen Cloath, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Clerk to bring in the Bread and Wine in a Wicker Basket and Glass Crewets at or just before the Prayer of Consecration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See his Letter to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> of <hi>Febru.</hi> 12.93.</note> Appoints New Orders, not us'd in other Churches, gives great <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Dissatisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Congregation,</hi> makes <hi>a long and notoriosly Scandalous Speech to them against their Curate;</hi> and after many other <hi>Disorders</hi> committed, on the <hi>Sunday before</hi> Christmas-<hi>Day, in the Year</hi> 1695. the said Sir <hi>G. W—r</hi> seizes the Keyes of all the Doors of the Tabernacle, <hi>forbids Mr.</hi> Milbourne <hi>the Pulpit,</hi> gives <hi>Another Ʋnlicens'd Clergy-man possession of the Reading Desk,</hi> sets <hi>a Chair before the Pulpit Stairs,</hi> seating <hi>himself</hi> in it during all the <hi>Time of Prayers,</hi> to <hi>prevent Mr.</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn's <hi>Preaching;</hi> and in short, forc'd <hi>the much greater part of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to hire a large <hi>Throwsters Shop,</hi> then by chance empty, at a very great Charge, where <hi>by and with the Express Order and Consent of our Right Reverend Diocesan</hi> they have since continued, <hi>Prayers, Preaching, and constant Catechising,</hi> being there still carryed on by the <hi>Curate Mr.</hi> Milbourne; But the place they so meet in, tho' <hi>far bigger then Sir</hi> G. W—rs <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is much too little for those <hi>vast Numbers</hi> which would gladly attend the <hi>publick Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>G. W—r</hi> still <hi>Officiates</hi> in his <hi>own Place,</hi> has an <hi>Ʋnlicens'd Assistant</hi> under Him, does what himself pleases undisturbed, has a full Congregation from the <hi>Old Artillery Ground, Northeme Falgate,</hi> and <hi>some few</hi> of the <hi>Inhabitants of Spittle-fields,</hi> whom the nearness invites to it; But neither <hi>does</hi> nor <hi>can supply</hi> our <hi>great Numbers</hi> with any <hi>such Place</hi> as we <hi>Petition</hi> for. Only He refuses <hi>to repay that Money</hi> which many of the Inhabitants <hi>out of their very streight Circumstances</hi> had laid out in <hi>Seats</hi> and <hi>Galleries,</hi> and endeavours to keep up <hi>Feuds and Contentions</hi> among the Neighbourhood, who were, otherwise, <hi>Kind to one Another, Peaceable, Well-minded, and ready to perform their Duties in all respests both to their God, and to their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> our <hi>Vicar,</hi> (who is most concern'd, had we presented any unjust Petition) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of our Request, and the <hi>best of our Neighbours,</hi> who make <hi>use</hi> of Sir <hi>G. W—r's Tabernacle</hi> have joyn'd with us in it, as being sufficiently sensible of the <hi>Ʋnsuitableness</hi> of <hi>that</hi> for our <hi>Extraordinary Necessities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Reasons have the more strongly obliged Us, to present our <hi>Humble Petition</hi> at this time, and We cannot Doubt the Favourable Assistance of this <hi>Honourable House</hi> in so <hi>Pious and Necessary a Work,</hi> the Attempts of all <hi>troublesome, unconcerned and busie Persons</hi> to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
